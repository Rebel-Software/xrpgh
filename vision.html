						<h2>Vision</h2>
						<p>A world where we build thriving connections within our society and environment, bringing hope and enabling us to decide the direction of our lives and futures. An inclusive world, where we work consciously to ensure fair processes of collective decision-making, where creativity is prioritised, and where our diversity of gifts are recognised, celebrated and flourish.</p>

					<h3>Creating a citizens' assembly</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="inner">

					<p>
					Our third demand is the creation of a citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice.

					<br><br>
					Decades of corporate lobbying and party politics have led to a climate and ecological emergency that poses an unprecedented existential threat to humanity and all life on Earth — “politics as usual” is no longer an option.

					<br><br>
					A Citizens’ Assembly provides us, the people, with a way to decide what’s best for our future, even if that requires radical changes in the present. Moreover, because they are informed and democratic, the Citizens’ Assembly’s decisions will provide political cover and public pressure for politicians to set aside the usual politicking and do the right thing.

					<h3>Building a regenerative culture</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="inner">				
					<p>
						We aim to create a culture which is healthy, resilient and adaptable.

						<br><br>
						A regenerative human culture is healthy, resilient and adaptable; it cares for the planet and it cares for life in the awareness that this is the most effective way to create a thriving future for all of humanity. Regenerative culture means improvements year on year, taking small steps to heal and improve, and on all levels, including individuals, communities, our soil, water and air. More than being a network of “activists”, we seek to find ways of being and doing that support positive change. This can include ceremony and prayer (in ways that are neither dogmatic nor expected) as formats to find inspiration from things bigger than ourselves. We need to reconnect with our love for ourselves, our country and our people alongside wider neighbours; people and the natural world.

						<br><br>
						Regenerative culture includes a healthy focus on mutually supporting categories of:

						<ul>
							<li>self care – how we take care of our own needs and personal recovery from this toxic system
							<li>action care – how we take care of each other whilst we undertake direct actions and civil disobedience together 
							<li>interpersonal care – how we take care of the relationships we have, being mindful of how we affect each other, taking charge of our side of relationships
							<li>community care – how we take care of our development as a network and community, strengthening our connections and adherence to these principles and values
							<li>People and Planet care – how we look after our wider communities and the earth that sustains us all
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							It’s about relationships. Our relationships with ourselves and personal histories, our relationships with what we struggle against, our relationships with other individuals day to day, and our relationships as a group – these are completely interdependent. Self care is also about taking care of the animal parts of the self that respond instinctively to stressful situations with fight or flight or faint.

					<h3>Final statement</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="inner">

					<p>
					Our world is in crisis. Life itself is under threat. Yet every crisis contains the possibility of transformation. Across the world, heralded by the young, people are waking up and coming together. 

					<br><br>
					We hear history calling to us from the future. We catch glimpses of a new world of love, respect and regeneration, where we have restored the intricate web of all life. It’s a future that’s inside us all – located in the fierce love we carry for our children, in our urge to help a stranger in distress, in our wish to forgive, even when that seems too much to ask. 

					<br><br>
					And so we rebel for this, calling in joy, creativity and beauty. We rise in the name of truth and withdraw our consent for ecocide, oppression and patriarchy. We rise up for a world where power is shared for regeneration, repair and reconciliation. We rise for love in its ultimate wisdom. Our vision stretches beyond our own lifespan, to a horizon dedicated to future generations and the restoration of our planet’s integrity.
					
					<br><br>
					<span class="small">
					The above vision statement was written in 2019 by some of the humans organising as part of XR UK, specifically people in the Guardianship and Visioning Circle. Every person in XR can and will have their own visions. Some of them will be shared. There is no definitive vision statement for XR, nor do we desire one.
